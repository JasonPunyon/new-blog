<p>Let’s play a guessing game. I’m going to choose a big set of numbers. Like a billion jillion numbers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This is R code. 
library(tidyverse)
generator_mean = floor(runif(1) * 10000 + 10) #SECRETS
generator_standard_deviation = floor(runif(1) * 30 + 10) #MORE SECRETS
my_numbers = rnorm(10000000, generator_mean, generator_standard_deviation) #OK fine it&#39;ll be 10 million instead of a billion jillion.</code></pre>
<p>My set of numbers has an average that you’re trying to guess.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_mean = mean(my_numbers)</code></pre>
<p>You get some numbers, let’s say 100, from my set.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample_size = 100
your_numbers = sample(my_numbers, sample_size)</code></pre>
<p>And now you guess. If you’re right you win! If not I win. Loser goes to the 😈 BAD PLACE 😈.</p>
<p>Easy game, right?</p>
<div id="no-fair" class="section level2">
<h2>NO FAIR</h2>
<p>This game isn’t very fair right now. Getting only a single guess makes this game pretty impossible for you. (OK fine, maybe I won’t send you to the 😈 BAD PLACE 😈 if you lose). The chance that your 100 numbers average out to the average of my jillion billion numbers exactly is pretty low.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(my_numbers) == mean(your_numbers) #NO CHANCE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>See?</p>
<p>I’m a good sport kinda guy though, so I’ll make you a deal. Instead of guessing a single number, you get to guess a range. If my average is inside your range, then you win!</p>
<p>Well…now the game is unfair in your favor. You can pick the whole number line as your range right? Then you’d always win (really glad I’m dropping the whole 😈 BAD PLACE 😈 thing 😅).</p>
<p>You’re a good sport kinda person though, so you’re gonna make me a deal. We’ll play the game over and over again and keep score. If you win 95% of the time, you win! If you win 96% of the time you lose. If you win 94% of the time, or any other percent of the time besides 95% you lose.</p>

<div id="what-the-f" class="section level2">
<h2>What the f?</h2>
<p>Quite the game ain’t it?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-bootstrap" class="section level2">
<h2>The Bootstrap?</h2>
<p>“The” Bootstrap is a technique you can use to win this game. “The” is in scare quotes there because there are a number of related techniques, this is the simplest one. The first step is taking a “bootstrap sample”. To do this you sample 100 (or whatever the original <code>sample_size</code> was) elements from your sample <em>with replacement</em>. Sampling from your sample is why The Bootstrap is called a resampling method.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>take_a_bootstrap_sample = function() {
  sample(your_numbers, sample_size, replace = TRUE)
}</code></pre>
<p>The second step is to calculate the statistic of interest (in this case, the mean) on your bootstrap sample.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>calculate_bootstrap_statistic = function() {
  mean(take_a_bootstrap_sample())
}</code></pre>
<p>You do steps 1 and 2 a lot. Like 10000 times, and put all the boostrap statistics together…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bootstrap_statistics = sapply(1:10000, function(x) calculate_bootstrap_statistic()) ## BASE R JASON?! ARE YOU WITHOUT COUTH?!</code></pre>
<p>Step three is to find the range that contains the middle 95% of your bootstrap statistics. This range is your final guess.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>conf_low = quantile(bootstrap_statistics, .025, names = FALSE)
conf_high = quantile(bootstrap_statistics, .975, names = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>So in this run your guess is that <code>my_mean</code> is between 6522.5 and 6527.8</p>
<p>In this round of the game <code>my_mean</code> = 6524. You WIN, YAY!</p>
</div>
<div id="but" class="section level1">
<h1>But…</h1>
<p>But your deal was that we play over and over again. Let’s play 1000 times. I’ll choose a different set of numbers for each game. You should win about 95% of these.</p>
<p>First let’s make a helper function that plays a round of the game and returns the results…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>play_game = function() {
  # I choose some numbers.
  my_numbers = rnorm(1000, runif(1) * 10000 + 10, runif(1) * 10 + 10)
  
  # You get a sample.
  your_numbers = sample(my_numbers, sample_size)
  
  # You do Bootstrap step one and two a bunch of times.
  bootstrap_statistics = sapply(1:10000, function(x) mean(sample(your_numbers, sample_size, replace = TRUE)))
  
  # Then Bootstrap step three, extract the interval. Then check whether you win...
  tibble(ConfLow = quantile(bootstrap_statistics, .025),
         ConfHigh = quantile(bootstrap_statistics, .975),
         PopulationMean = mean(my_numbers)) %&gt;%
    mutate(YouWin = ConfLow &lt; PopulationMean &amp; ConfHigh &gt; PopulationMean)
}</code></pre>
<p>We’ll use that function to play the game 1000 times and calculate your win percentage.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tibble(GameId = 1:1000) %&gt;%
  mutate(Game = map(GameId, ~ play_game())) %&gt;%
  unnest() %&gt;%
  count(YouWin) %&gt;% # Count the wins
  mutate(Percent = n / sum(n)) %&gt;% # Calculate the percentage
  filter(YouWin)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   YouWin     n Percent
##   &lt;lgl&gt;  &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 TRUE     948   0.948</code></pre>
<p>Close enough :)</p>
