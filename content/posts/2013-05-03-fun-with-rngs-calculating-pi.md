So, calculating &#960; is a fun pastime for people it seems. There are many ways to do it, but this one is mine. It's 12 lines of code, it wastes a lot of electricity and it takes forever to converge.

{{< codeblock lang="csharp" >}}

public double EstimatePi(int numberOfTrials)
{
    var r = new Random();

    return 4 * Enumerable.Range(1, numberOfTrials)
      .Select(o => {
	     var x = r.NextDouble();
	      var y = r.NextDouble();
	      return Math.Pow(x, 2) + Math.Pow(y, 2) < 1 ? 1 : 0; }
      ).Average();
}

{{< /codeblock >}}

What's going on here? First we initialize our random number generator. Then for 1 to the number of trials we specify in the argument we do the following:

1. Generate two random numbers between 0 and 1. We use one for the X coordinate and one for the Y coordinate of a point.
1. We test if the point (X,Y) is inside the unit circle by using the formula for a circle (x^2 + y^2 = r^2).
1. If the point (X,Y) is inside the circle we return a 1 otherwise a zero.

Then we take the average of all those zeros and ones and multiply it by a magic number, 4. We have to multiply by four because the points we generate are all in the upper right quadrant of the xy-plane.

How bad is it? Here's some output:  

|Number Of Trials|Estimate of Pi|
|---|---|
|10|3.6|
|100					|3.24|
|1000				|3.156|
|10000				|3.1856|
|100000				|3.14064|
|1000000				|3.139544|
|10000000			|3.1426372|
|100000000			|3.14183268|
|1000000000			|3.141593 (Took 2:23 to complete)|
