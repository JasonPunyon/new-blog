      <description>Last I left you, dear readers, I had just been given an offer to work my dream job at Stack Exchange by Joel. I accepted the offer on the spot, and went home walking on air. What do you do when you get the offer for your dream job? You go home, crack open a bottle of wine and write your resignation letter.
Achieving a dream is really liberating. I&amp;rsquo;d written a resignation letter before, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like this.</description>
